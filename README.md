Evaluating the Profitability and Operational Feasibility of Short-Term Rental Expansion: A Sensitivity Analysis Approach

## 1. Business Objective

Watershed Properties is evaluating whether to convert a subset of its long-term rental properties into short-term rentals. The objective of this project is to assess profitability, capital requirements, and operational feasibility under varying market and cost assumptions, while respecting a strict capital constraint.

## 2. Key Business Questions

Under what conditions does short-term rental conversion become profitable?

What is the worst case and best case profitability scenario?

Which assumptions have the largest impact on profits?

Given a $500,000 capital constraint, how many properties should be converted?

Which property types and locations should be prioritized?

## 3. Data & Tools Used

Data Extraction	:                     SQL
Financial Modeling:	                 Microsoft Excel
Sensitivity Analysis:	               Excel + Tableau
Visualization:	                       Tableau Public
Reporting:	                           Word (White Paper), PowerPoint

## 4. Financial Model Overview

The financial model estimates:

Conversion costs per property

Operating expenses (utilities, upkeep, fees)

Revenue from short-term rentals

Net cash flow and yearly profits

Outputs are calculated per property and aggregated across portfolios.

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis Design

Key assumptions tested:

Profitability threshold

Conversion cost

Transaction & regulatory fees

Average rental period

Yearly upkeep

Utilities and service costs

Each parameter was tested across realistic minimum and maximum ranges to identify risk exposure and upside potential.

## 6. Tableau Dashboard

The interactive dashboard allows decision makers to:

Adjust assumptions dynamically

Compare fixed vs variable parameter models

Visualize geographic concentration of profitable properties

Identify top-performing property types

## 7. Key Insights

Profitability is most sensitive to rental duration and upfront conversion cost

Houses in high demand urban clusters consistently outperform apartments (2 Bedroom houses outperform in top performing cities- Texas, Florida, California)

Profitability drops sharply beyond a certain threshold value

Geographic clustering enables phased conversion strategies

## 8. Final Recommendation

Given the $500,000 capital constraint, Watershed should:

Convert 20 out of 244 properties in Phase 1

Prioritize houses over apartments

Focus on high-performing geographic clusters near coast- Florida, Texas, California

Expand in stages based on realized cash flow

This approach maximizes profit while minimizing financial risk.
